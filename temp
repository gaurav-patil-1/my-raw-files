Demo: Let's say you're interested in a new app or a software program. A demo is like a guided tour of that app. It shows you how it works, what features it has, and how it can be useful for you, all before you decide to download, use, or buy it.

DNS (Domain Name System): The internet works on numbers called IP addresses. But remembering numbers for every website would be hard, right? DNS is like a phonebook.
